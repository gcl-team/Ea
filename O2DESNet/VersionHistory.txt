Rename Static property of a normal Component as "Config".
Therefore, they coincide with Statics of a Simulation as "Scenario".

Simplifies structure of Component definition, by encapsulate StaticProperty based on root class, i.e., Component<TStatics> : Component.

- Version 2.1.0
1. Remove TScenario and TStatus in Component paradigm
2. Construct Simulator by Assembly (Component)
