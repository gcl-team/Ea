# Ea
Inspired by and forked from O�DES.NET, Ea is a framework for object-oriented discrete event simulation.

It hybrids both event-based and state-based formalism, and implement them in an object-oriented programming language. As it is event-based in the kernel, O�DES.NET is able to model the structure and behaviors of a system precisely. On top of it, the state-based formalism enables modularization and hierarchical modeling. Besides, the object-oriented paradigm abstracts the model definitions and makes them seamless to interact with analytical functionalities, regardless of their fidelity levels.

It is developed and used by C#, which facilitates flexible integration with the latest academic research in simulation analytics and enables the connection to a variety of industrial-standard modern developments from the .NET ecosystem, including mobile applications, enterprise software, Mix-Reality, and Artificial Intelligence.
